"""A streaming JSON writing library.

JSON streams provides a simple, object oriented, interface for writing JSON
data as a stream, without building a complex data tree first. This is
advantageous when working with particularly large data sets that would consume
a lot of memory to build out completely, or when using systems with constrained
memory.

The interface is designed to be as safe as possible, and provides context
manager interfaces to maximize this safety.

Basic usage:

Create a Stream instance, which will be either an object (in JSON terminology,
dict in python terminology), or an array (list in python terminology). Then use
the write method to write elements into the file.

>>> with Stream('array', filename='foo') as s:
...     s.write('foo')
...     s.write('bar')

Each element can also open a subelement, either via the subarray() or
subobject() method.

>>> with Stream('array', filename='foo') as s:
...     s.write('foo')
...     with s.subobject() as o:
...         o.write('1', 'bar')

Any object that can be serialized can be passed (although passing some elements
as object keys is not supported, and should not be passed).

>>> with Stream('object', filename='foo') as s:
...     s.write('foo', {'foo': 'bar'})

It is very important to note that while the Array and Object classes present
the same API, the signature of their write and iterwrite methods are
necessarily different. For write, Array accepts a single element, for Object it
requires two elements, the key and the value. With iteritems Array accepts a
an iterable returning a single valid item, while Object accepts an iterable
returning a (key, value) tuple pair.

>>> with Stream('object', filename='foo') as s:
...     s.iterwrite(((str(k), k) for k in range(5)))
...     with s.subarray('foo') as a:
...         a.iterwrite(range(5))
